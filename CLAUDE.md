# project-shanni-happy — working notes for Claude

A hands-free, voice-driven build of a small **flat papercraft** game. The user does
not hand-author art or code; everything is programmatic and driven through Claude Code.

## Locked art direction (do not drift)

Flat, minimal, **clean** Paper-Mario papercraft. NOT realistic, NOT anime, NOT noir
(noir was tried and dropped). "High fidelity" to this user = clean execution: no
clutter, no clashing colours, no stray lines/artifacts, calm negative space.

- One base graphic per NPC (chibi, generated in Gemini), static by default. A *few*
  characters add a SMALL set (1–3) of alternate **pose images** for the rare moment the
  drawing itself must change (e.g. Chrees curling a dumbbell). These **hard-swap** —
  instant, no tween, Paper-Mario style. Every pose image of a character shares ONE
  canvas + foot baseline + body scale (registered by `studio/register_poses.py`,
  vision-checked by `studio/qa_vision.py`) so the swap can't resize or unground them.
  Most characters still have exactly one image. See the `papercraft-asset` skill §4.
- ALL motion = the paper cutout physically moving: hop-walk (squash on contact, stretch
  in air, slight lean), jump (squash → launch → airborne → land squash), contact shadow
  that shrinks/fades with height. Personality is in the motion (and, sparingly, a pose
  swap) — **never a tween between two drawings.** (The old "jump-for-joy" celebration +
  pastel sparkles were removed at the user's request — do NOT re-add them.)
- Character **Shen** = `studio/refs/shen-chibi-4.png` (pink bucket hat, round glasses,
  dark braids, dusty-rose jacket over gray tee, cream floral skirt).
- Environments use the same flat pastel paper set (flat bands, soft rounded hills,
  cream die-cut props, contact shadows). See the 6 mood specs in `studio/specs/all.json`.
- **Foreground = model it; texture only flat grain.** In the reachable world (plaza,
  street, stairs, park) build structure as *separate modeled paper pieces* (sign board,
  awning, window frames, door) and keep the kit small (no fussy mullions, brick, or trim).
  Texture carries only flat pastel grain: one small shared seamless tile at a single fixed
  texels-per-metre, big or unique textures are reserved for the unreachable backdrop, and
  every in-world sign sits on its **own die-cut board**, never baked into a wall. Test: if
  you can NAME it (a sign, a window, a door) model it; if you can only FEEL it (grain,
  mottle) texture it. Full how-to lives in the **`papercraft-texture`** skill.

## Renderers (two, by purpose)

- **PIL (`studio/env_render.py`)** — fast 2D iteration. `SceneSpec (data) -> PNG`.
  Used to explore environment concepts quickly. NOT the game engine.
- **Three.js (`studio/*.html`)** — the real renderer. Orthographic camera (flat
  papercraft → no perspective warp). `poseAt(t)` is a pure deterministic pose function.

### Three.js gotcha — preview playback

The Claude preview renders pages as a **background tab where `requestAnimationFrame`
is suspended** (frozen frame). Drive real-time playback with a `setInterval` clock
keyed off `performance.now()` instead (see `env-live.html` `__startAuto`). The shoot
scripts call `__stopAuto()` then `__render(t)` for deterministic capture.

## Sound — every interaction makes a sound (do not ship silent interactions)

**The rule:** if the player does something, or the world reacts to them, it is **audible.**
Any new interaction — a new collectible, NPC action, button, door, quest beat, menu, screen
transition — **ships its sound effect in the same change that adds it.** A silent interaction
is a bug, not a "later." Stay on-aesthetic: soft, warm, calm pastel — never harsh or loud (the
master chain caps level, but still pick gentle params). Like the art, personality lives in
motion + sound, not in louder.

**The second rule: world sounds are spatial.** A sound that comes from a *place* in the world
— an NPC's animation loop, an ambient prop, a distant event — **must be attenuated by the
player's distance to it**: full only when the player is near, fading with distance, and **not
fired at all** once they're far. A world sound audible across the whole map is a bug, exactly
like a silent interaction is. (Player-centric sounds — the player's own footsteps / jumps —
and UI / dialogue sounds are *not* spatial; they play full.) Mechanism: pass a 0..1
multiplier to `Sound.sfx(name, mul)`; `proxGain(x,z)` in `game.html` is the standard rolloff
(full ≤~2.5u, squared falloff to silent ~9u, skips the call past the edge). **When you add any
sound, ask: does it come from a spot in the world? If yes, gate it through `proxGain` in the
same change** — same reflex as shipping its sound at all.

**The third rule: sound is CONTEXTUAL to the space (right sound, right loudness).** A sound must
MATCH its source — never reuse a sound just because it's wired up. (Christopher flagged this: the
fish tanks used the **fountain water** ambient — wrong identity AND wrong level, "fountains are
obviously louder than fish"; "remember this general concept, not this exact example.") So pick the
SFX that fits the object and scale its base level to how loud that object really is — a fish tank is
a soft `bubble` (its own `CFG.sfx` level), quieter than a fountain, not the fountain rush. **Music
is per-scene/contextual too:** each scene declares a `music` track (`spec.music`). The **overworld
track is EXCLUSIVE to the overworld**; an interior gets its own track, OR one **shared across like
rooms** (e.g. every pet-shop-style indoor can share one indoor loop). `Sound.startMusic(url)`
switches on a scene change — it crossfades to a DIFFERENT url, no-ops (keeps looping) for the SAME
url, and caches each decoded buffer by url (returning is instant); it tracks the PLAYING url
separately so it never stops the old track without starting the new (the "music gone / wrong song
everywhere" bug). `game.html`'s `buildScene` calls it on every scene build; `beginGame` starts the
boot scene's track; never let one scene's music bleed into another. When you add a room, pick (or
reuse) its music + ambient SFX to fit that space — same reflex as the two rules above.

**The system:** all **SFX + the dialogue voice** are **procedural Web Audio**, synthesized at
play time in `studio/js/audio.js` — **no asset files for those** (same ethos as the art:
programmatic, no hand-authoring). The module exports `Sound`; it's already wired into
`game.html`, so new sounds plug into existing seams rather than new plumbing. The one
**exception is background music** — a single seamless ~26s loop **generated programmatically
with MusicGen** (`gen_music.py` + `make_loop.py`, NOT hand-authored) and committed as one small
OGG (`out/music/calm.ogg`), because real-time music synthesis isn't practical. It plays through a
**music sub-bus** under the master, so the volume slider + mute already scale it.

- **Add a new SFX:** write a tiny synth fn in the `SFX` map in `audio.js` (use the `note()`
  and `noise()` helpers; set its level in `CFG.sfx`), then trigger it with `Sound.sfx('name')`.
- **Trigger it — two patterns, pick by where the event lives:**
  1. **Sim-driven** (emerges from the deterministic sim/physics: footsteps, jump, land,
     hamster pickup `squeak`) → detect the **state transition** in `audioStep(s)` in `game.html`,
     comparing against `aprev` (mode / onGround / walkPhase). It runs every fixed step, so fire on
     the *edge* (changed-since-last), never every frame.
  2. **Discrete UI/events** (menus, buttons, dialogue, transitions) → call `Sound.sfx('name')`
     right at the event site, or wire a `Dialogue.on*` hook (`onReveal`, `onChoiceOpen/Move/Pick`,
     `onLine`, `onEnd`) in `game.html`.
- **Positional sounds are proximity-gated** — see the "world sounds are spatial" rule above; any
  world-anchored sound goes through `proxGain` (Chrees' rep `lift` does), with the multiplier passed
  to `Sound.sfx(name, mul)`.
- **Dialogue voice:** the Charlie-Brown muted-brass "wah" is `Sound.blip(ch, speaker)`, one per
  revealed glyph (fired from `Dialogue.onReveal`). A new speaker gets its timbre in `VOICES`.
- **Gesture gate:** browsers block audio until a user gesture — `Sound.resume()` is already
  wired to the title **Start** / first key / first tap, so new triggers don't handle it.
- **Background music:** `Sound.startMusic(url, autoplay=true)` (called from `beginGame()`,
  after the gesture) fetches+decodes once and loops a single `AudioBufferSourceNode` (gapless —
  NOT an `<audio>` element) through the music sub-bus. **Auto-plays only on a real deploy:**
  `beginGame` passes `BUILD!=='dev'`, so the loop starts itself on GitHub Pages (where `build.json`
  exists → `BUILD` is a git sha) but stays **silent in a local dev worktree** (no `build.json` →
  `BUILD==='dev'`). `autoplay=false` only *arms* the track (sets URL + preloads); the music slider
  (`setMusicVolume`) still starts it on demand, so it isn't a dead control in dev. `Sound.stopMusic()` /
  `Sound.setMusicVolume(0..1)` (0 = off) / `Sound.toggleMusic()`; the **music** pause-menu slider
  drives it, persisted to `shen.musicvol` (own key — NOT in the save blob). Decode failure degrades
  to "no music", never a crash.
- **⚠️ Background music MUST loop seamlessly — every time, no exceptions.** A loop with an audible
  seam/click/gap is a bug, not "good enough." MusicGen (and most generators) do NOT loop natively,
  so you always run the loop step: render a little long (~30s), then `make_loop.py` does an
  **equal-power crossfade of the tail back over the head** so the wrap lands on two
  originally-consecutive samples (no click) with a continuous envelope (no level jump). NEVER commit
  a raw generated clip as the loop. **VERIFY the seam** before shipping (don't trust your ear over a
  background tab): decode the OGG in an `OfflineAudioContext` and check the wrap discontinuity
  `|x[0]-x[N-1]|` sits within the clip's own adjacent-sample-delta distribution (well under its max)
  — that's a numeric proof the loop is gapless. To make a NEW loop, follow the `gen_music.py` →
  `make_loop.py` flow in `requirements-music.txt`. **⚠️ Pick the seed by LOOP-CLEANLINESS, not only
  by `make_loop.py --analyze`'s "calmest" score.** The OGG wrap is decoder-dependent: a brighter /
  busier clip (higher centroid + `max_delta`) leaves a vorbis+resample seam at the loop point even
  though it's seamless at the source rate — for `shop.ogg`, the analyzer's "fewest-transients" pick
  (seed 2) had a browser wrap **1.78× p99.9** (a real seam) while the mellower seed 0 was **0.01×**
  (perfect). Build a loop from EACH seed, decode each in the browser, and pick the lowest
  `wrap/p999` (mellower clips also fit cozy interiors better).
- **Three independent levels, all automatic** — **master** "volume" + mute (`shen.vol`/`shen.muted`,
  scales everything), **effects** (`shen.sfxvol`, the SFX+voice sub-bus), **music** (`shen.musicvol`,
  the music sub-bus). Each has its own pause-menu slider. Never gate or scale a sound yourself —
  SFX/`blip` route through the effects sub-bus and music through the music sub-bus, both under the
  master, so just call `Sound.sfx` / `Sound.blip` / `Sound.startMusic` and the sliders cover it.
- **Verify in preview** (don't assume): spy on `Sound.sfx` / `Sound.blip`, drive the interaction,
  assert the event fired the sound, console clean. (Exactly how the audio work verified
  step/collect/blip — wrap the fn, push calls to a log, read it back.) `Sound` is on
  `window.audio` for spying. The reusable version is **`node studio/qa_audio.mjs`** (fresh
  headless context, no module-cache trap): it spies on `window.audio` to assert the tanks emit
  `bubble` (not the fountain `setWaterLevel`) and that music is per-scene (calm→shop→calm across
  the door). Add an assert there when you add a contextual sound.

## How to run

```sh
python3 -m venv studio/.venv && studio/.venv/bin/pip install -r studio/requirements.txt
npm install && npx playwright install chromium   # once per worktree — the QA scripts + Stop hook need it
.claude/serve.sh            # prints http://localhost:<port>/game.html for THIS worktree
```
The `npm`/playwright step powers `studio/qa_audit.mjs`, `studio/qa_shots.mjs`, and
`test/smoke.mjs` (all headless-Chromium). The committed **Stop hook** won't let a turn end
with un-audited world changes, and clearing it runs `qa_audit.mjs` — so without playwright
local QA can't pass. (See the **QA reflex** section.)
Then `preview_start` the **`game`** config and open the printed URL (e.g.
`/game.html` or `/env-live.html`). The asset pipeline is the `papercraft-asset`
skill (`.claude/skills/papercraft-asset/`).

### Showing the user something — ALWAYS via per-worktree localhost, never `file://`

Christopher works in **git worktrees** and needs to view *this* worktree's version of
the game, not the main checkout's. A raw `file://` path also can't actually run the
game (ES modules + `fetch` are CORS-blocked off `file://`). So whenever you want him to
look at the game (or any `studio/` page):

1. Run `.claude/serve.sh` — it writes a **git-ignored** `.claude/launch.json` pointed at
   *this* worktree's `studio/` and prints the URL. Each worktree gets its **own
   deterministic port** (base derived from the worktree path, first free port up), so
   multiple worktrees serve their own game side-by-side; the URL is stable once chosen.
2. `preview_start` the **`game`** config (this is also what you use to verify changes).
3. Give him the full `http://localhost:<port>/game.html` link — and **repeat that exact
   link every time** you point him at something, so he never has to scroll back for it.

`/done` tears the server down (`.claude/serve.sh stop` + `preview_stop`).

## Workflow: deploy & done (PR-based — never push to `main`)

Work happens in **git worktrees** (one per session/chat), each on its own branch.
`main` is **branch-protected**: it only accepts changes through a pull request that
passes the **`smoke`** check. Do NOT `git push origin main` (or `HEAD:main`) — that's
how work has accidentally landed on `main` before. Multiple sessions run at once, so
always `git fetch origin main` and check for peers before acting.

- **`/deploy`** = go live. Commit on the worktree branch → `git push -u origin HEAD` →
  open a PR (`gh pr create --base main`) → wait for `smoke` green (`gh pr checks --watch`)
  → if `BEHIND`, read the incoming diff then `gh pr update-branch` → squash-merge
  (`gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`). Merging `main` triggers the Pages deploy
  (`deploy.yml`). After merge, the worktree branch is **refreshed to merged `main`**
  (`git reset --hard origin/main`) and you keep working in the same worktree; the next
  `/deploy` opens a fresh PR off the same branch name.
- **`/done`** = close out the worktree. Resolve pending work (offer `/deploy`), confirm
  the branch landed on `main` via its PR, sync the primary checkout, tear down the worktree.
- **CI**: `ci.yml` runs the `smoke` job on every PR — assembles the site and loads
  `game.html` in headless Chromium asserting `window.__ready` + no errors
  (`test/smoke.mjs`, uses `playwright`). This is the required check that gates merges.

## Conventions

- Python tooling lives in `studio/`, computes paths from `__file__` (repo-relative).
- Generated assets land in `studio/out/`. Keep the committed art (`shen-cut`,
  `shen-paper`, `env-bg`, concept sheets); intermediate frame dirs are git-ignored.
- Secrets: image gen uses the Gemini key from 1Password; **never commit keys**.
  `studio/.exec` is a machine-specific chrome path (git-ignored).
- `.claude/launch.json` is **generated per-worktree by `.claude/serve.sh` and
  git-ignored** (holds this worktree's unique port + absolute `studio/` path) — never
  commit it or hardcode a port.

## QA reflex — a problem pointed out ONCE becomes a permanent check (not optional)

Christopher reports a visual/world/interaction problem **once**. He should never have to
report the same *class* of problem twice. When he points one out, the job is not just to fix
*that instance* — it is to make sure that kind of defect is **caught automatically, forever,
before anything is ever called done.** This is the standing reflex; treat every bug report as
"add a permanent check," not "patch this spot."

**The four-step reflex — do all four, every time he flags something:**
1. **Fix** the instance he pointed at.
2. **Generalize** it to the class. "This hamster sits on the centre-line and freezes me" →
   "no pickup may sit on a forced corridor." "These two shops flicker where they touch" →
   "no two footprints overlap." Name the *category*, not the coordinate.
3. **Promote it to a check — prefer DETERMINISTIC code over an eyeball.** This is the most
   important step and the one that keeps the system from rotting:
   - **If it can be detected in code (geometry, reachability, framing, boot), write a
     deterministic assertion** that fails loudly — like `window.__overlaps()` or
     `cameraQA.reach()`. Add it as **a new file in `studio/qa/checks/`** (auto-discovered by
     `qa_audit.mjs` — no central file to edit, so branches never conflict; add a `window.__*`
     probe in `game.html` if the check needs one). Write it **generically** — "no overlaps in
     general", never "this one example". Code never forgets, runs in seconds, gates
     automatically. **Always try this first.** See `studio/qa/README.md`.
   - **Only if it is genuinely subjective** (colour clash, "reads as the wrong object",
     "looks web-ish") does it go into the **visual sweep as a NAMED line** — append it to the
     `TAXONOMY` in `.claude/skills/papercraft-env-qa/visual-qa.workflow.js` and the
     recurring-failure-modes table below, as "we were burned by X — specifically check X." A
     generic "look for clipping" is weaker than a named past failure.
4. **Record it** — the failure-modes table in the World/asset QA gate section below + a
   `feedback` memory, so it survives across sessions. See [[shanni-world-qa-gate]] and
   [[shanni-qa-capture-reflex]].

**Two tiers of QA, and the gate runs them automatically:**
- **Deterministic audit (fast, always-correct, never forgets):** `node studio/qa_audit.mjs`
  is a thin runner over an **auto-discovered registry** — every `studio/qa/checks/*.mjs`
  (boot, geometry, reachability, camera framing/visibility today). **Exit 1 on any failure**;
  on a clean pass it writes `.claude/.qa-stamp` (the world-file hash). Runs on **every**
  world-touching change — it is cheap. New deterministic checks are **new files** in
  `studio/qa/checks/`. All QA scripts boot via the shared `studio/qa/harness.mjs`
  (`withGamePage`, free port — never copy-paste a server or hardcode a port).
- **Visual sweep (needs EYES — screenshots, seriously looked at):** `node studio/qa_shots.mjs`
  (full screenshot battery + per-object close-ups, exit-coded + stamps) → the **multi-agent
  picture sweep** (`/papercraft-env-qa`). **The best way to catch a visual problem is to take
  a screenshot and actually study it** — a deterministic check is NOT a substitute for
  looking. Run this for **any** visual/world change (not deploy-only) and **always** before
  `/deploy` + `/done`. This is the "really big sub-agent QA run" — scale it up freely;
  thoroughness over brevity. Full contract + how to add checks/scenarios: `studio/qa/README.md`.

**The hard gate (enforced, not just documented):** a committed **Stop hook**
(`.claude/settings.json` → `.claude/hooks/qa-gate.mjs`) refuses to let a turn end while
`studio/game.html`, `studio/specs/world.json`, or `studio/js/*` are **dirty vs `HEAD` AND
have not passed the deterministic audit since the last edit** (it compares the live world
hash to `.claude/.qa-stamp`). The hook is instant — it never launches a browser, it just
checks git + the stamp. **To clear a block: run `node studio/qa_audit.mjs`** (fix anything it
reports; it re-stamps on a clean pass). The hook fails *open* on any internal error, so it can
never wedge a session, and it self-limits to one block per stop via `stop_hook_active`. The
shared world-file list + hash live in `.claude/hooks/qa-lib.mjs` (imported by both the audit
and the hook so they can't drift). See [[shanni-qa-capture-reflex]].

## Cameras — ALWAYS QA them (not optional)

Whenever you add, move, or tune a camera/zone, you MUST run the camera QA as part of
building it — it is part of "done", not a follow-up. Invoke the **`/zone-camera`** skill
(`.claude/skills/zone-camera/`) and enforce its cardinal rule:

> **Shen must be visible from every reachable spot and through every transition.**

But **visible is the floor, not the goal** — also enforce the **framing rules**:
> **Shen is never a tiny dot (≥ ~13% of the screen, AIM ~15%+), and never looked
> down on top-down (3/4 view, angle ≤ ~32°).** She sits BEHIND and slightly above,
> not overhead. For an open area where she'd drift far, DON'T zoom out — keep the camera
> close and use a zone **`trackWid`** so the eye follows her across the field (constant
> size). The hard floor/ceiling are `CAM_MIN_FRAC` / `CAM_MAX_PITCH` in `game.html`.

Three design rules: **one fixed camera per zone** (never vary the angle by travel
direction — that flips the eye into a wall on reversal), **contain the player** so
every reachable spot is inside a zone, and **keep her big + low-angle** (small-ish
`back`, `height` ≲ ~0.7×`back`; pulling `back` way out to flatten the angle is the trap
that shrinks her and walks the eye into neighbouring buildings).

Workflow every time: author the camera → serve the worktree on localhost (never
`file://`) → in the preview run `cameraQA.static()` (visibility) AND `cameraQA.framing()`
(size + angle; reports `minSize`/`maxPitch`), `cameraQA.transition([a],[b])` for
cross-junction pairs, AND `cameraQA.path([...])` for **round-trips** (down a road and
back, up the stairs and back — reversals hit transitions a one-way sweep misses; they
also catch a blend grazing a building that `static` won't) → `cameraQA.warp(x,z)` +
screenshot any failure → fix → re-run until **0 failures** on both. (The occlusion
check raycasts BUILDINGS only, so eyeball prop-heavy areas — a tree between camera and
Shen won't be flagged.) A camera change with unrun or failing QA is not finished.
Reference + harness: `studio/test-scene.html`.

## World/asset QA gate — RUN EVERY PUSH that touches a world or asset (not optional)

Whenever you add/move/retexture buildings, props, surfaces, terrain, colliders, or a new
asset, you MUST run this gate before calling it done / before `/deploy`. `/zone-camera`
proves Shen is *visible*; it does NOT prove the world *looks right* or is *traversable*.
These bugs recur every build — audit for ALL of them, every time. Full how-to +
detection commands + root-cause code refs live in the **`/papercraft-env-qa`** skill
(this is the standing summary so it's not forgotten between sessions).

**The gate (all must pass):**
0. `node studio/qa_audit.mjs` → the fast deterministic audit (boot + `__overlaps` + `reach`
   + `framing` + `static`), **exit 0 = clean** (and it stamps `.claude/.qa-stamp`, clearing
   the Stop hook). This is the always-run floor; run it after every world edit. The steps
   below are the heavy battery on top of it.
1. `node test/smoke.mjs studio` → green (boots, no JS errors).
2. `node studio/qa_shots.mjs` → captures the zone battery + flicker pairs + a **per-object
   close-up of EVERY placed prop & building** (`studio/out/qa/props/`) AND prints
   **`✓ geometry audit clean`** (`window.__overlaps()`=`[]` and `cameraQA.reach()` all
   reachable). Footprint overlaps = z-fight/clipping; unreachable = a wall blocks a route.
   **Every single thing placed in a session must be screenshotted and looked at** — zone
   shots hide per-object defects (a barrier that reads as a bench, a prop facing wrong, a
   shrub clipping a wall). Inspect the `props/` close-ups, not just the wide shots. Also
   capture a **texture close-up of every textured surface at the CLOSEST reachable gameplay
   distance** (plus each sign straight-on); a blurry / stretched / clashing / low-res-text
   surface fails the gate (the whole-object `props/` frame is too far away to be a resolution
   read). Once a texel-density audit is wired into `qa_shots.mjs`, also require it to print
   **`✓ texture density uniform`**. (Both the close-up pass and the audit are to-build; see
   the `/papercraft-env-qa` and `/papercraft-texture` skills.)
3. In the preview (`/zone-camera`): `cameraQA.static()`=0 + `cameraQA.path()` round-trips=0,
   AND `cameraQA.walk([a],[b])` on every corridor (`stuckAt` null).
4. **Multi-agent picture sweep** over `studio/out/qa/*.png` (template
   `.claude/skills/papercraft-env-qa/visual-qa.workflow.js`) — but trust the geometric
   audit over the sweep's synthesizer (it once mis-dismissed a real z-fight as a "hedge join").
   Fix everything found → re-shoot → repeat until clean.

**Cardinal rules:** (1) **Never the abyss** — no reachable spot/angle may see off the
edge of the world; build PAST the edge, ring open areas with buildings, block with
believable objects (hedges / construction `barrier`), backfill with `buildBackdrop()` + fog.
(2) **Stay on the locked look** — no clipping, no stray outlines, no clashing colours.
(3) **Interior / loading-zone rooms** — three hard rules, all learned the hard way:
**(a) the background is NEVER pitch white** — every scene has an intentional background
colour (or skybox); interiors set it via `Sky.setInterior(on,{bg,…})`. **(b) the floor STOPS
at the walls** — it covers exactly the room footprint (tucks just under the wall thickness, no
seam) and must NEVER extend past the walls or into the non-accessible area beyond (a floor that
runs out into the background reads as a hard floating edge / soft abyss; do NOT "fix" an
edge-against-void by enlarging the floor — fix the background colour). **(c) walls LINE UP** —
a room's walls share ONE height so the corners meet cleanly (no step where a short side wall
meets a tall back wall). After ANY world/interior build, **screenshot it from several angles and
actually look at the consistency** (bg, floor boundary, wall alignment) — don't trust the geometry
audit alone for these.

**Recurring failure modes → root cause → fix (audit for each):**
| Symptom | Cause → Fix |
|---|---|
| Windows/door sunk into ground | building `base`=`groundHeight`; box `bottom=base` (NO downward extension) |
| Dark squares / mottled patch / flicker on a park-edge wall | box extended below base INTO the retaining wall (vertical z-fight) → `bottom=base` |
| Two buildings/stairs flicker where they meet | overlapping footprints → `window.__overlaps()` must be `[]`; separate them |
| Road/plaza/sidewalk shimmer seam | coplanar surfaces same height → distinct per-kind `y`-eps (+ `lift`) |
| Stray white/cream outline lines | `EdgesGeometry` on the wrong thing → `edge=false` on buildings + rounded/small props (keep only as deliberate die-cut) |
| "Invisible circle" blocks a path | coarse box collider (`r=0.5·min(w,d)` → r=2 bulge) → tight perimeter ring (~0.55); confirm with `cameraQA.walk` |
| Silent unreachable area | a stray collider walled it off → `cameraQA.reach()` `unreachable` must be `[]` |
| Clip THROUGH a prop (slide/climber) | one centre collider → per-part `cols:[{dx,dz,r}]` |
| Prop faces the wrong way | make it orientation-free (lamp = top globe) or set per-prop `rot` |
| Props that don't belong / overlap | bushes on a road, bench on a bush → streets = lamps/trees, park = bushes; space props ≥~3u; the `placement` lens |
| Blurry / smeared wall or prop up close | 256px `paperTex` + fixed `repeat 1.6` (too few texels/m) → one 1024px `gen_paper` set via `loadPaper()`, `paperUV(geo,0.18)`, max anisotropy + mipmaps |
| Grain stretched (wide vs tall face differ) | `BoxGeometry` 0..1 UVs → `paperUV()` so texels-per-metre is constant on every face |
| Sign text low-res / stretched | text baked into the `facadeTex` wall canvas (`k=48` px/m) → a dedicated `makeSign()` board at ~220 px/m × dpr on its own thin box off the wall |
| Fake structure painted into a wall | a sign / window / door drawn into `facadeTex` → MODEL it as a thin box/plane in `makeFacade` (foreground = model it; texture only flat grain) |
| Neighbour textures clash at a seam | mismatched density/phase or two unrelated maps → ONE shared paper map, per-mesh tint, same `DENSITY`, world-space (`paperUV` or triplanar) phase |
| Texture not QA'd at resolution | the deterministic `texture-density` check (`window.__textureDensity()` → `{lowDensity:[]}`, run by `node studio/qa_audit.mjs`) now guards texels-per-metre per face; ALSO shoot every changed surface at the CLOSEST reachable distance + each sign straight-on (crisp / uniform / seamless / blended / legible) |
| Blurry / mis-aligned building textures | big stretched maps → MODEL foreground structure as separated thin geometry, texture only for flat grain + distant backdrop; uniform texel density; `checks/texture-density.mjs` |
| Hard seam where two textures/materials meet | adjacent maps don't blend → named sweep line; share a palette/tile, soften the join |
| Sky/light seeping through a gap between adjacent shopfronts | facade gap to the void → close the gap / build city behind it (abyss rule); named sweep line |
| Sky/void over the rooftops or between backdrop blocks (short/gapped skyline) | backdrop ring too short or its near rings gapped → near rings GAPLESS (`fill>1, jit 0`) + tall in `buildBackdrop()`; deterministic `checks/sky-leak.mjs` (`window.__skyLeak()` → `leaks:[]`, casts outward from each edge) AND `checks/camera-abyss.mjs` (`window.__camAbyss()` → `leakCount:0`, raycasts the REAL zone camera at every reachable cell — catches a center-view gap the edge-cast misses) |
| Sweep cries "ABYSS/void" but geometry is sound | the vision synthesizer mis-reads **fog-washed / flat-grey backdrop or a retaining wall** as void — TRUST `__camAbyss()` (0 void rays from every reachable cell) over the synthesizer; the fix (if any) is warming/de-flattening the distant palette (diorama-lens taste), NOT adding geometry |
| **Interior background is pitch WHITE** | a colour string reached `THREE.Color` **without a leading `#`** → `THREE.Color('e8cba2')` silently parses to WHITE (only `'#e8cba2'` is correct). Normalise every colour (`v[0]==='#'?v:'#'+v`) before `new THREE.Color()` / `.set()`. Each scene sets an intentional non-white bg via `Sky.setInterior`. Guarded by `checks/scene-background.mjs` (`window.__sceneBackgrounds()`). |
| **Interior floor runs past the walls / floats against the bg** | the floor plane is bigger than the room → its cut edge floats. Size it to the room footprint only (`(x1-x0)+th × (zF-zB)+th`, no `+9`/forward bias). Beyond the walls is the BACKGROUND colour, not more floor. Guarded by `checks/floor-bounds.mjs` (`window.__floorOverruns()`=`[]`). |
| **Room walls don't line up at the corners** | side walls and back wall built at different heights (e.g. `wallH` 4.5 vs `backH` 5.4) → a step at the corner. Give a room ONE wall height. |
| **Door/shelf/sign has the WALL drawn over it; one prop clips THROUGH another** | a fixture recessed INTO the wall (placed at wall centre `z`) → the wall front occludes it; or a shelf board spans a tank. Mount fixtures PROUD of the wall front face (`zBack + th/2`); a tank SITS ON a shelf board (y-touch). `window.__clips()` / `window.__interiorOverlaps()` (3D per-mesh audit over `userData.fx`-tagged fixtures) must be `[]` — guarded by `checks/interior-overlap.mjs`. |
| **A long/thin prop (shelf) walls off the room** | a single circular collider `r=½·max(w,d)` (≈4u for a width-8 shelf) bulges a huge invisible wall → blocked the counter. Use `pushBoxColliders` matching the footprint (swap w/d when rotated). Tell: `cameraQA.static`/`framing` cell count drops. |
| **Muddy / blurry CAST shadows on the ground** | the sun's shadow map spread thin over a huge frustum (`±60` ÷ `2048` ≈ 17 texels/u) → smudge edges. Density = `mapSize ÷ (2·frustumHalf)`. Fit a FIXED frustum to the scene's reachable bounds (`Sky.setShadowBounds` from `spec.bounds`) + a bigger map: `4096`÷`±53` ≈ 38 t/u for town. Guarded by `checks/shadow-quality.mjs` (`window.__shadowInfo()` → `texelsPerUnit ≥ 28` + `soft` at the top tier). |
| **CAST shadows crawl / flicker as the player moves** | a shadow frustum that FOLLOWS the player swims its texels every frame (world-x/z snapping is wrong for an angled light → the edge crawls, worst under small props like bushes). FIX: a FIXED, world-locked frustum (`Sky.setShadowBounds(cx,cz,half)` per scene) — it physically can't shimmer. Never follow the player with the shadow camera. |
| **DOUBLE shadow under one object (a pool below + a cast shadow to the side)** | a 3D modelled prop both casts a REAL shadow (`M()` sets `castShadow=true`) AND gets a `contactShadow()` oval → two shadows. RULE: 3D props (tree/bench/bush/fountain…) cast the real shadow ONLY (no oval in `buildProps`); flat BILLBOARDS (Shen/NPCs/pickups, `castShadow=false`) get the oval ONLY. Each thing = exactly one shadow of the right kind. |
| **Cast shadow fuzzy / jagged / hard (not an accurate real-life bleed)** | the built-in shadow filters are all wrong for this: `PCFSoftShadowMap` is a fixed-width DITHERED blur (reads fuzzy/jagged), `PCFShadowMap` is hard, `VSMShadowMap` LIGHT-BLEEDS small props to nothing. FIX: **PCSS** (`js/pcss.js` patches `ShaderChunk.shadowmap_pars_fragment`) = contact-hardening soft shadows — crisp where an object meets the ground, bleeding softer with distance (sun read as an AREA light). `installPCSS()` runs BEFORE any material compiles; `renderer.shadowMap.type=PCFShadowMap` (PCSS short-circuits `getShadow`). Guarded by `checks/shadow-quality.mjs` (`__shadowInfo().pcss`). |
| **PCSS shadows wash out / small props lose their shadow** | the PCSS **filter radius is in shadow-UV, not texels** — `0.024` UV ≈ 98 texels at 4096 → samples over a huge area → averages the shadow to nothing. Keep `PCSS_MAX` a FEW texels (`~0.006` UV ≈ 24 tx); `PCSS_SOFT` ~0.13, `MIN` ~0.0006. Also tighten the shadow camera near/far to the light's real distance (`setShadowBounds`: outdoor ~40/178, interior ~2/48) so packed-depth precision resolves the blocker gap. |
| **Small-prop shadows vanish entirely** | (a) `VSMShadowMap` light-bleed (don't use VSM); (b) `shadow.normalBias` too high (`0.4` peter-pans the shadow off small casters) → keep `~0.02`; (c) PCSS filter radius too big (row above). The big building still casts (large occluder) while trees/benches lose theirs = the tell. |
| **Soft contact-shadow oval too sharp/dark (vs the soft cast shadows)** | the die-cut oval's rim feather too tight → widen the canvas blur so it matches the soft world shadows: `ctx.filter='blur(s*0.085)'` over a filled ellipse (`r≈0.355·s`, alpha ~0.46) on a 256px canvas + mipmaps. Visual-sweep item (subjective edge). |
| Edits not showing on reload | browser cached `specs/world.json` → fetched `cache:'no-store'`; hard-reload. **The preview hard-caches ES modules and WON'T re-fetch even on reload** — a fix can be in the served file yet the page runs old code (symptom: `'newThing' in window.audio` is false). FIX: `studio/js/*.js` are imported in `game.html` with a `?v=N` cache-bust — **bump N when you edit any module**. Also verify in a FRESH headless context (`node studio/qa_audit.mjs` / `studio/qa/scenarios/*`). |

## Status / next

- DONE: **Shadow rework + graphics menu** — fixed three shadow problems Christopher flagged
  (first "always very blurry edges"; then on a follow-up: flicker, double shadows, too sharp).
  Final approach:
  - **Soft + ACCURATE (PCSS):** the built-in filters all fail here — PCFSoft is a fuzzy/jagged
    dither, VSM light-bleeds small props away. So `js/pcss.js` patches the shadow shader to do
    **PCSS** (contact-hardening soft shadows: crisp where an object meets the ground, bleeding
    softer with distance — the sun read as an AREA light). `installPCSS()` before any material
    compiles; type stays `PCFShadowMap` (PCSS short-circuits `getShadow`). Density from a FIXED
    frustum fit to the scene (`4096`÷`±53` ≈ 38 t/u for town), not the old muddy `±60`÷`2048` ≈ 17.
    ⚠️ PCSS filter radius is in shadow-UV (a few texels), NOT a big number — too big washes small
    props out. (First pass used PCFSoft/`shadow.radius`; the user flagged it as fuzzy → PCSS.)
  - **No flicker:** the shadow frustum is FIXED + world-locked (`Sky.setShadowBounds(cx,cz,half)`
    from `spec.bounds`, called by `buildScene`). The earlier player-FOLLOWING frustum is what made
    shadows crawl/swim under the bushes; a fixed one can't shimmer. (`setShadowFocus` removed.)
  - **No double shadows:** every 3D prop's `M()` meshes cast a REAL shadow, so `buildProps` no
    longer also adds a `contactShadow()` oval (that was the "one below + one to the side" the player
    saw on the tree). 3D props (tree/bench/bush/fountain…) → real cast shadow only; flat BILLBOARDS
    (Shen/NPCs/pickups, `castShadow=false`) → soft contact OVAL only (oval blur widened to match).
  - **Graphics menu** (Settings → `Gfx`): three independent chips on their own `shen.gfx.*` keys
    (like the volume mix), applied live + persisted — **shadows** (off/low/high; both tiers soft,
    the tier trades map resolution), **finish** (the `fx.js` lens: off/minimal/diorama/full,
    defaults **off** so it's opt-in), **resolution** (fast 1× / crisp `min(dpr,2)`). Mobile/
    coarse-pointer defaults shadows to **low**. Chip click plays `select`.
  - Deterministic **`checks/shadow-quality.mjs`** (`window.__shadowInfo()` → `soft` + `texelsPerUnit
    ≥ 28` + `blurRadius>0` at the top tier + the `__gfx` knobs wired) so shadows can't silently
    regress to muddy/hard. `window.__gfx()`/`__gfx(kind,val)` console+QA hook. Audit 10/10 green,
    smoke green; town + park (tree/bench/bush single soft shadows) + interior + all menu knobs
    verified in preview. See the failure-modes table (six shadow rows) + [[premium-look-overhaul]].
- DONE: **QA capture reflex + hard gate** — a problem Christopher reports once becomes a
  permanent check (fix → generalize → promote to a **deterministic** assertion → record).
  New **`studio/qa/`** = the single QA home: a shared `harness.mjs` (`withGamePage`, free
  port — kills the copy-pasted server + the `PORT=8788` collision) and an **auto-discovered
  check registry** (`qa/checks/*.mjs`); `studio/qa_audit.mjs` is now a thin runner over it,
  exit-coded, stamps `.claude/.qa-stamp` on a clean pass. **Add a check = add a file** (no
  central edit → branches don't conflict). `qa_shots.mjs` exit-codes + stamps. Contract +
  per-branch fold-in: `studio/qa/README.md`. A committed **Stop hook**
  (`.claude/settings.json` → `.claude/hooks/qa-gate.mjs`, shared hash in
  `.claude/hooks/qa-lib.mjs`) **blocks finishing a turn while world files are dirty + un-audited**
  (instant: git + stamp, never launches a browser; fails open; one block per stop). Clear it
  with `node studio/qa_audit.mjs`. Heavy multi-agent sweep runs on every `/deploy` + geometry
  change. Verified end-to-end (clean→pass, dirty→block exit 2, re-audit→clear). See the **QA
  reflex** section above + [[shanni-qa-capture-reflex]].
- DONE: **Camera framing pass** — every zone retuned to a calmer 3/4 view (no top-down;
  the worst, the `corner`, went from ~56° to ~26°) and a bigger Shen (min ~13%, AIM ~15%+
  of screen). New **`trackWid`** zone field gives the open `park` a 2D follow so she stays
  a constant size wherever she roams (was a tiny dot off-centre). New **`cameraQA.framing()`**
  + `CAM_MIN_FRAC`/`CAM_MAX_PITCH` guardrails in `game.html` make "not too small / not
  top-down" permanent 0-failure gates. Full QA green (framing, visibility, round-trips).
  Rules written into `/zone-camera` (SKILL + REFERENCE) and the Cameras section above.
- DONE: character cutout + die-cut; walk + jump (hop); 6 environment moods;
  pipeline migrated into the repo; **3D Paper-Mario game loop** (`studio/game.html`
  + `studio/js/sim.js`) — perspective follow-camera (Shen always centred),
  full-window responsive, 2D ground movement, depth-sorted billboard props
  (walk behind/in front), d-pad + keyboard; `/deploy` skill
  + GitHub Pages. **Live: https://metroxe.github.io/project-shanni-happy/**
- DONE: **Removed flower collecting + jump-for-joy** (user request). No more flower
  collectibles, no score/win HUD, no joy mode/button/`J` key/sound. The only
  collectibles are hamsters (Adrian's quest). The **Talk** action button is now
  contextual (shows only when beside an NPC); **hop** is always shown. Chrees kept as
  a flavour NPC with rewritten (non-flower, non-quest) dialogue. No `SAVE_VERSION`
  bump (removed ids drop via sanitize; the removed `q_chrees` is ignored on load).
- DONE: **NPC dialogue system** (`studio/js/dialogue.js`) — walk-up proximity prompt
  over the NPC, bottom dialogue box with typewriter reveal, advance-on-button, and
  branching **choice menus** (↑/↓ or d-pad to pick; Talk/Enter/Space/click to confirm).
  Movement is **not** gated while talking — any move input walks Shen and **ends the
  conversation** (`resolveInput` calls `Dialogue.end()`); in an open choice menu ↑/↓
  still navigate, ←/→ still walk you out. Data-driven: per-NPC trees live in `world.json` under
  `npcs[]` (`{name, tex, x, z, h, dialogue:{start, nodes:{id:{text, speaker?, next?,
  choices?}}}}`). NPCs render as grounded billboards with idle paper breathing + a greet
  hop. First NPC **Chrees** (buff, red headband, long hair, black tank) → `out/chrees-paper.png`.
- DONE: **`studio/gen_image.py`** — reusable Gemini image-gen (text→image, optional
  `--ref` style/face conditioning); made Chrees using chibi #4 as a style ref. Key: env
  `GEMINI_API_KEY` from 1Password item **"Bowmark Gemini Key"** (id
  `s66drdsfeobdn5brqel5kvdtta`, vault `Christopher-Macbook-CLI`); model `gemini-3-pro-image`.
  `cutout.py` now takes an optional name arg: `cutout.py <src.png> <name>` →
  `out/<name>-cut.png` + `out/<name>-paper.png`.
- DONE: **Save system** (`studio/js/save.js`) — localStorage persistence keyed
  `shanni-happy:save`. Saves on `visibilitychange→hidden` + `pagehide` (true "exit
  any time", sync write finishes during teardown), on every flower pickup, and a 10 s
  interval backstop for hard kills. **Title / continue screen** (`#title` in game.html):
  New Game / Continue over the dimmed live world; gameplay input gated by `started`;
  New Game asks "Erase save?" once before wiping an existing save. Defensive load:
  `sanitize()` clamps position to bounds, intersects collectible ids with the current
  world, recomputes score; the whole load is try/catch → worst case "fresh start" (bad
  blob stashed under `…:save:backup`). Debug surface: `window.game.{save,wipe,saveData,
  start,reset}`. Verified end-to-end (collect→reload→continue, stale-id drop, OOB clamp,
  corrupt JSON, future-version, erase guard).

  ### Save compatibility — WE control it (not the deploy/build version)
  `build.json` (the deploy git-sha) is a **debug label only and never decides whether a
  save loads.** Compatibility is governed by two things we own in the project:
  - **`SAVE_VERSION`** (integer in `studio/js/save.js`). A loaded save with an *older*
    `v` is **discarded → clean fresh start** UNLESS `migrate()` has a step that walks it
    up to the current `v` (then progress is preserved). A *newer* `v` (reverted deploy)
    is preserved-but-ignored. So bumping `SAVE_VERSION` is the deliberate "this breaks
    old saves" switch.
  - **Stable collectible ids** (`world.json` `id:"f1"…`). Progress is a SET of collected
    ids, never array indices. **⚠️ NEVER renumber/reuse an id once shipped** — that
    silently corrupts saves and is exactly what the id scheme prevents.

  **Bump rule — before every deploy, judge whether the diff breaks saves:**
  - **Do NOT bump (the common case):** new / moved / removed flower (ids + sanitize
    cover it), art / colour / prop / cloud / hill changes, new NPC or dialogue, physics
    tuning, or adding a NEW saved field that load defaults when it's absent.
  - **Bump `SAVE_VERSION`:** the *meaning or units* of a saved field change (e.g. the
    coordinate system, so old `x`/`z` map to the wrong place), a saved field load relies
    on is removed/renamed without a safe default, `collected` semantics change, or
    restoring an old position/progress would soft-lock or misplace the player. Bump =
    discard old saves; to keep progress instead, also add a `migrate()` step. When
    genuinely unsure, prefer bumping — a clean reset beats a silently broken world.
  The `/deploy` skill enforces this check at push time.
- DONE: **Procedural audio** (`studio/js/audio.js`) — all Web Audio synthesis, **no asset
  files**. Gameplay SFX via sim-transition detection (`audioStep` in game.html), UI/dialogue
  SFX via `Sound.sfx` + `Dialogue.on*` hooks, and a Charlie-Brown muted-brass dialogue voice
  (`Sound.blip`, per-speaker `VOICES`). **Pause menu** (Esc / ☰) with a master volume slider +
  mute, persisted (`shen.vol` / `shen.muted`); audio unlocks on first gesture. See the
  **Sound** section above for the "every interaction makes a sound" rule + how to add one.
- DONE: **Background music — PER-SCENE** (`calm.ogg` overworld, `shop.ogg` pet-shop) — each a
  seamless ~26s loop generated with **MusicGen-medium** (`gen_music.py` → 30s clips, `make_loop.py`
  → equal-power crossfade + `oggenc`; env in `requirements-music.txt`. Generated on **CPU**). Each
  scene declares `spec.music`; `Sound.startMusic(url)` **crossfades** to a different track, **no-ops**
  on the same one (seamless), and **caches each decoded buffer by url** so returning is instant.
  `buildScene` switches it on every scene build; `beginGame` starts the boot scene's track. The
  overworld song is exclusive to the overworld; interiors get their own (or a shared indoor) track —
  see the "third sound rule" above. `shop.ogg` = seed 0 (mellow/cozy, wrap 0.01× p999). Decode
  failure (e.g. a track not yet rendered) degrades to "no music", never a crash.
- DONE: **Independent volume mix** — `audio.js` now has **two sub-buses under the master**: SFX +
  dialogue-voice route through `sfxGain`, music through `musicGain`. **Three pause-menu sliders** —
  master **volume** (`shen.vol`/`shen.muted`), **effects** (`shen.sfxvol`), **music**
  (`shen.musicvol`, 0 = off) — each its own key, none in the save blob. `Sound.setSfxVolume` /
  `setMusicVolume` / `setVolume`; defaults reproduce the old single-volume behaviour exactly.
- DONE: **Quest system + journal book** (`studio/js/quests.js` + the journal UI in `game.html`).
  - **Engine** (`Quests`, UI-agnostic like `dialogue.js`): data-driven quests in `world.json`
    `quests[]` (`{id, name, giver?, summary?, steps:[{desc, goal?}]}`). Goal types auto-advance
    against the live world: `collect` (`{kind?,ids?,count?}` — counted from the collected set, so
    progress is **derived on load**, never stored), `talk` (`{npc}`), `reach` (`{x,z,r?}`),
    `manual`. State is compact (`{status,step}` per quest) + persisted in the save blob's new
    `quests` field (additive — **no `SAVE_VERSION` bump**; absent → fresh). Hooks `onStart/onAdvance/
    onComplete` drive sound + toasts. `Quests.note({type,...})` is fed from game seams; `Quests.list()`
    feeds the journal.
  - **Wiring**: dialogue nodes carry an optional `action` (`"start:q_hamsters"`) fired via
    `Dialogue.onAction`; NPCs get a `quest` field + `entryNode()` picks a **state-aware greeting**
    (default intro / `progress` / `ready` / `done` nodes by quest status). Collecting feeds
    `note('collect')`; talking feeds `note('talk')`.
  - **Journal** = the pause menu replacement (Esc / 📖). A **book** with **left binder-divider tabs**
    (📜 Quests, ⚙ Settings) and a **page-flip** on switch (`#pages` rotateY). Quests tab = expandable
    list (name + giver → summary, rose "current task" box with a progress bar, done/active/future
    step rows). Settings tab = the three volume sliders + mute + restart/resume (relocated, same ids).
    Quest milestones show a `#qtoast` + a badge dot on the 📖 button when closed.
  - **Content (Rocky-themed town)**: **Adrian** the shy pet-shop clerk (`out/adrian-paper.png`, Gemini
    chibi → `cutout.py`) gives **Hamster Roundup** — find 5 escaped **hamsters** (`out/hamster-paper.png`,
    collectible `kind:"hamster"`, scattered) and return them. This is now the **only** quest —
    **Chrees** is a flavour-only NPC (his "Bloom the Block" flower quest was removed with flowers).
  - **Sounds** (all procedural, `audio.js`): `squeak` (hamster), `quest`/`questStep`/`questDone`,
    `book`/`bookClose`/`flip`. Verified in preview: full lifecycle (accept→auto-track→complete),
    real dialogue acceptance for both NPCs, journal DOM + page-flip, save round-trip, **camera QA 0 fails**.
- DONE: **Loading zones (multi-scene + doors)** — the world is no longer a single scene. Each scene is
  a spec (`SCENE_URLS` in `game.html`: `town`=`specs/world.json`, `petshop`=`specs/petshop.json`); a
  scene swap is `clearScene()` (drop the `sceneRoot` group) → `buildScene(spec, spawn)` (rebuild city or
  interior + collectibles + npcs + colliders + camera warp). Persistent objects (base ground, Shen,
  shadow, burst, Sky) live OUTSIDE `sceneRoot` and travel between scenes.
  - **Doors/portals** are data-driven: a scene's `portals[]` (`{id,x,z,r,to,spawn,label,door:{…}}`) +
    named `spawns{}` (where you arrive from a given portal). Walk up → contextual **"🚪 Enter"** prompt
    (same seam as the Talk prompt; a door never fights an NPC for the key) → `startPortal()` runs a
    cream-fade **walk-through transition** (`updateTransition`: walk INTO the door + shrink → cover →
    swap scene → step out + uncover), with a shop-bell `door` SFX + footsteps. `#fade` overlay + `trans`
    state machine; gated so it can't fire mid-dialogue/mid-transition.
  - **Town door**: a framed "PET SHOP" entrance (`buildPortalDoors`, awning + sign + bell) set into the
    park-side cliff under the existing Pet Shop building (reachable park spot — the town is otherwise
    walled corridors with no reachable building face). **Adrian moved INSIDE** the shop (he was on the
    street); the hamster quest is now given/returned in the shop. Town keeps Chrees.
  - **Pet shop interior** (`specs/petshop.json`, `interior:true` → `buildInterior` + the `IPROP` map):
    a Rocky-style "J&M Tropical Fish" room — sage walls + wood floor + baseboards, a counter with Adrian
    behind it (thin front-face collider so you can talk across it; `TALK_R` 2.6), glowing translucent
    **fish tanks** (drifting fish, reuse the spatial water ambient via `fountains`), a **birdcage** w/
    bird (spatial `chirp` ambient via `ambients[]`), hanging + potted plants, rug, welcome mat, exit door,
    a "J & M PET SHOP" sign, warm ceiling `PointLight`s. `Sky.setInterior(on,cfg)` hides the outdoor dome
    + sets a warm **non-white** background + warm light. **Enclosure rules (cardinal — see the QA gate):**
    the floor covers the room footprint and **stops at the walls** (never extends past/behind them); the
    background beyond the walls is the bg colour, NOT more floor; all walls share **one height** so corners
    line up. One fixed `shop` zone camera, QA'd. (⚠️ `THREE.Color('e8cba2')` w/o `#` parses to WHITE — the
    bug that made the bg pitch-white; normalise colours.)
  - **Global collected set + save**: pickups update a game-level `collected` Set (reconciled against
    `S.collectibles` each frame — robust to multi-substep frames; the per-step `S.justGot` flag is for
    SFX only) so progress survives scene swaps; quests read this global set. `save.js` gained an additive
    `scene` field (absent → town; **no `SAVE_VERSION` bump** — old v3 saves still load) + multi-scene
    sanitize (clamp to the saved scene's bounds; collected ids validated across all scenes).
  - **QA harnesses** (fresh-context, no module-cache trap): `studio/qa_petshop.mjs` (camera 0-fails both
    scenes + talk-across-counter + input-path round trip + interior/abyss shots), `studio/qa_save.mjs`
    (cross-scene persistence + old-save compat), `studio/qa_quest.mjs` (full hamster loop with Adrian
    inside). All green; smoke + town `qa_shots` geometry audit still clean; multi-agent visual sweep =
    enclosed/on-aesthetic. New SFX: `door`, `chirp`.
- IN FLIGHT: **Premium look overhaul** (make it less "web-ish"). Working brief + A–Z of style
  directions + concerns + method: **`studio/PREMIUM_LOOK.md`** — READ IT before doing visual work.
  Two pieces already exist: (1) a post-processing finishing lens `studio/js/fx.js` (`EffectComposer`
  presets `off|minimal|diorama|full`, toggle `window.__fx('diorama')`; **diorama accepted as the final
  10% lens**; SSAO parked — billboard halo); (2) the **`papercraft-texture`** skill that fixes the
  blurry/stretched surfaces (256px fixed-`repeat` → crisp seamless tiles + world-space UVs). The brief
  says the real win is in the **bones** (palette, textures, toon, UI skin, character rim), not the lens.
- NEXT (ideas): more NPCs/quests (drop-in: add art + a `world.json` npc/quest); conversation state
  (remember choices) — persist into the reserved `npcs:{}` slot already in the save blob; more zones/goals;
  per-mood music loops (6 palettes in `specs/all.json`); idle polish. NOTE: photos in the macOS **Photos library** are unreadable from bash
  (TCC blocks `cp`/`sips`/`qlmanage` on `~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/originals/…`)
  — have the user drag the image into chat or export it to `studio/refs/` to use as a gen ref.
